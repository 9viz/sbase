who \- print who has logged on
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B who

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B who
prints a list of who has logged on, their controlling tty, and the 
time at which they logged on.

.SH BUGS
.B who
relies on the utmp file to be updated responsibly. This
doesn't always happen, which can cause who to print completely
bogus data.

musl\-libc currently implements all utmpx functions as stubs Obviously,
this command cannot work under such conditions.
