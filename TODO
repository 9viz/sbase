The following list of commands is taken from the toybox roadmap[0] and
has been stripped down  accordingly.  Commands that belong to ubase[1]
are not listed here as well as commands that fall outside the scope of
sbase such as vi and sh are also not listed here.

at
awk
bc
diff
ed
file
find
getconf
install
join
make
od
patch
pathchk
stty
tabs
tput

The  following  programs have  been  imported  from  OpenBSD and  need
replacing or cleaning up:

printf

If you are looking for some work to do on sbase, another option is to
pick a utility from the list in the README which has missing flags or
features noted.

We also need to add support for UTF-8. We have imported libutf from
suckless.org and reworked all tools which used wchar.h.
What is left to do is replace all instances of wctype.h-usage with
functions in runetypebody.h, which is much saner than wctype.h.
