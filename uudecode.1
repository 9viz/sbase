.TH UUDECODE 1 sbase\-VERSION
.SH NAME
uudecode \- decode a uuencoded file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uudecode
.RI [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B uudecode
reads file (or by default, the standard input) and writes a decoded
version to the file specified in the uuencoded header. In case that
the file already exists, it is truncated. Otherwise a new file is
created. After the operation the permissions of the created/accessed
are changed to reflect the mode in the header.
.SH NOTES
This version of uudecode does not currently support the base64
encoding algorithm.
For safety currently uudecode operates only on regular files and
stdout. Trying to uudecode to a link, directory, or special file
yields an error.
